Maiden,YuulDachi,"Inaaaa!

I would like to thank you for your existence. I'm in my 4th year in college and things have been stressful, but I have your streams and comfy presence to calm me down. I honestly did not think you would be my favorite out of all the vtubers I watch (I've fallen in the rabbit hole and I can't get up!) but your words and the stories you share sometimes hits a little too close to home, and it makes me reflect a lot about my self and I find that really helpful.

Never stop being you! = w=)7",
Speedyboi,Takodachi,Happy Anniversary Ina! You are so cool and your streams really make my day! Takodachis forever! :D,
Cptcoconuts,Takodachi,"Before I started to watch hololive the pandemic was a constant repeat of the same day without any progress. I started with Coco Kaichou and immediately my interest for hololive sparked but I can't say I didn't fall into the rabbit whole until Ina debuted. From all the girls in holomyth Ina called out to me the most and now she is my ultimate bias. I just would like to say that I love all you do, I'll keep on watching until the very end.
