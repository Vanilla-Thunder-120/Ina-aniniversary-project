Ina’nis


Not here, nor nowhere,
I’m invisible like air.
Nothing around me but pity,
Or my own feelings of being ugly.


Maybe I heard this call
Anyway, I came with the nightfall.
Ending in a puddle, I met our goddess:
Ninomae Ina’nis, an honest priestess.


Instead of paying, she has puns.
Near to her, a calm campfire
Or the strong feeling of, deep inner.


Monster, maybe I am.
A Takodachi surely I became
Et inanis adimpleam me et gaudium",

Decrilus,Takomfy,"Hello Ina~ Happy 1 year anniversary!!!! I've always looked up to people who have the talent for drawing and thought that I could never set foot on their domain. Yet, ten months later, here I am drawing fanarts of hololive, vtubers, and you. You're one of the factors that lit my passion for drawing. If it weren't for your involvement in Hololive, I don't think I would've picked up the pen at all. The butterfly effect started with you. Thank you for the motivation and words of wisdom!~",ina_anniversary_submission_-_Decrilus.png
